## What is this?
This is an app that allows you to right-click and add images to an image grid in a new tab/window

## But why???
I made this specifically for my player-facing screen when running tabletop RPGs.
I use Obsidian for all of my campaign management, so it's nice to be able to quickly
display NPC portraits and other such images to the group in real-time.

I can't think of any other potential use cases. It's not a very useful plugin.
